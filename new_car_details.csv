Widely available as a used vehicle, the Suzuki Ravi 2024 remains in demand for various commercial uses, which causes its price to vary significantly based on condition. Showroom dealers often avoid stocking it due to lower profit margins, but it is readily available through official dealers at an approximate price of 1.86 million PKR, which is competitive for its class.Externally, the Suzuki Ravi 2024 features a very simple design with a black grille and front indicators positioned on the hard plastic bumper. The rear indicators are located in the trunk. The interior is equally straightforward, accommodating two seats with a very basic setup devoid of any luxury features, including a music system. The pickup's primary function is for transportation, though modifications can be made to suit different needs.Under the hood, the Suzuki Ravi 2024 is powered by a standard 800cc engine with Euro II emission standards. This 0.8-liter OHC 6-valve inline-3 engine, paired with a 4-speed manual transmission, produces 37 bhp at 5000 RPM. The engine is designed for efficiency and fuel economy, providing smooth gear shifts and reliable power delivery. The vehicle averages around 10 km/l, giving it an estimated range of 360 km from its 36-liter tank, although actual mileage may vary based on load weight.The Suzuki Ravi 2024 is available in three colors: Pearl Red, Solid White, and Silky Silver. Its main competitors include the FAW Carrier, known for its durability and affordability; the Hyundai Shehzore, which offers a spacious cargo bed and decent performance; the JAC X200, a Chinese mini-truck noted for its reliable performance and load-carrying capacity; and the Changan M9, a compact MPV with modern styling, a spacious interior, and a range of advanced features for urban commuting and family transportation.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Introduced in Pakistan in 1979, the Alto initially gained popularity as the Suzuki FX, the market's cheapest car with three engine configurations: 539cc T5B, 543cc F5A, and 796cc F8B. The Pakistani Suzuki Alto is available in four variants: VX, VXR, VXR AGS, and VXL AGS, with the VXL AGS often commanding higher prices due to demand. Despite stiff competition, the Alto remains favored for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and readily available spare parts. Each generation of the Alto has seen upgrades in design, engine capacity, and features: 2nd Gen (1984): Enhanced transmission options, including 4/5 Speed Manual, 2 Speed Automatic, and 3 Speed Automatic. 3rd Gen (1988): Introduction of a sliding door in the 4-seater model and standardization of the 660cc engine. 4th Gen (1994): Removal of the sliding door, launch of the Alto SV model with fuel economy features and amenities like air conditioning, power steering, ABS, and an audio system. 5th Gen (1998): Increased dimensions and introduction of CVT transmission. 6th Gen (2004): Boxier design with a 660cc K6A engine, UV glass panel, rear camera, and infotainment system. 7th Gen (2009): Curvier exterior with modern features such as traction control and eco mode. 8th Gen (2014): Retro-style design with features like keyless entry, push-start, traction control, vehicle stability control, seven airbags, collision alert, and retractable side mirrors. Turbocharged variant available, boasting a fuel consumption of 37 km/l in Japan. 9th Gen (2021): Boxier design, larger dimensions, modern features, and new engine options, including a 660cc petrol engine for the base variant and a mild hybrid system for upper variants. The exterior of the Suzuki Alto 2024 is small and economical, allowing easy maneuverability in urban traffic. The rear lights are integrated into the bumper, and the headlights and turn signals are combined into one unit. The front grille is uniform across models, with colored door mirrors and handles exclusive to the VXL variant. Retractable mirrors are also a VXL-only feature. The interior of the Alto is basic but functional, featuring a combination of dark and light grey on the dashboard. The speedometer provides necessary information like fuel average, instant fuel average, distance to empty, and fuel indicator. The automatic gear shift is conveniently placed next to the steering wheel. The car includes analog climate control, two cupholders in the front and back, and a console box. The VXL variant adds practical features such as power windows, retractable mirrors, dual airbags, and electric power steering. The Alto 2024 is powered by the new R06A engine, a 3-cylinder 660cc engine producing up to 39 horsepower and 56 Nm of torque, coupled with a multipoint injection fuel system. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual or AGS (Auto Gear Shift). The Suzuki Alto 2024 offers impressive fuel efficiency, with an estimated mileage of 18 to 20 km/l, making it ideal for cost-conscious consumers. Maintenance is straightforward, thanks to the vehicle's long-standing presence in the market and the widespread availability of spare parts and knowledgeable mechanics. The Alto's ride and handling are characterized by its nimble performance, attributed to its small size and lightweight construction, allowing easy navigation through city streets and tight parking spaces. While it offers stability and minimal body roll, the compact size may compromise comfort and space for passengers and luggage. Competitors of the Suzuki Alto 2024 in Pakistan include Suzuki Mehran, Daihatsu Mira, Nissan Dayz, United Bravo, and Prince Pearl. Despite competition, the Alto maintains an edge due to Suzuki's reputation as a reliable brand and an extensive dealership network.

Introduced in Pakistan in 1979, it quickly gained popularity as the Suzuki FX, the market's cheapest car, with engine configurations of 539cc T5B, 543cc F5A, and 796cc F8B. The Pakistani Suzuki Alto is available in four variants: VX, VXR, VXR AGS, and VXL AGS, with the VXL AGS often commanding higher prices due to demand. Despite competition, the Alto remains a preferred choice for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and easy availability of spare parts. Each generation of the Alto has seen upgrades in design, engine capacity, and features: 2nd Gen (1984): Enhanced transmission options, including 4/5 Speed Manual, 2 Speed Automatic, and 3 Speed Automatic. 3rd Gen (1988): Introduction of a sliding door in the 4-seater model and standardization of the 660cc engine. 4th Gen (1994): Removal of the sliding door, launch of the Alto SV model with fuel economy features and amenities like air conditioning, power steering, ABS, and an audio system. 5th Gen (1998): Increased dimensions and introduction of CVT transmission. 6th Gen (2004): Boxier design with a 660cc K6A engine, UV glass panel, rear camera, and infotainment system. 7th Gen (2009): Curvier exterior with modern features such as traction control and eco mode. 8th Gen (2014): Retro-style design with features like keyless entry, push-start, traction control, vehicle stability control, seven airbags, collision alert, and retractable side mirrors. Turbocharged variant available, boasting a fuel consumption of 37 km/l in Japan. 9th Gen (2021): Boxier design, larger dimensions, modern features, and new engine options, including a 660cc petrol engine for the base variant and a mild hybrid system for upper variants. The exterior of the Suzuki Alto 2024 is small and economical, allowing easy maneuverability in urban traffic. The rear lights are integrated into the bumper, and the headlights and turn signals are combined into one unit. The front grille is uniform across models, with colored door mirrors and handles exclusive to the VXL variant. Retractable mirrors are also a VXL-only feature. The interior of the Alto is basic but functional, featuring a combination of dark and light grey on the dashboard. The speedometer provides necessary information like fuel average, instant fuel average, distance to empty, and fuel indicator. The automatic gear shift is conveniently placed next to the steering wheel. The car includes analog climate control, two cupholders in the front and back, and a console box. The VXL variant adds practical features such as power windows, retractable mirrors, dual airbags, and electric power steering. The Alto 2024 is powered by the new R06A engine, a 3-cylinder 660cc engine producing up to 39 horsepower and 56 Nm of torque, coupled with a multipoint injection fuel system. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual or AGS (Auto Gear Shift). The Suzuki Alto 2024 offers impressive fuel efficiency, with an estimated mileage of 18 to 20 km/l, making it ideal for cost-conscious consumers. Maintenance is straightforward, thanks to the vehicle's long-standing presence in the market and the widespread availability of spare parts and knowledgeable mechanics. The Alto's ride and handling are characterized by its nimble performance, attributed to its small size and lightweight construction, allowing easy navigation through city streets and tight parking spaces. While it offers stability and minimal body roll, the compact size may compromise comfort and space for passengers and luggage. Competitors of the Suzuki Alto 2024 in Pakistan include Suzuki Mehran, Daihatsu Mira, Nissan Dayz, United Bravo, and Prince Pearl.

Based on the Indonesian model but tailored for Pakistani preferences, it features enhancements like an advanced AC system, a 2-DIN integrated 9-inch LCD option, defoggers, and a boot parcel tray. Introduced in April 2014 with three trims (VX, VXR, and VXL), the VX trim was phased out in 2016, while the VXL was upgraded in January 2020 to include AGS automated-manual transmission and driver-side airbag options. Externally, the Wagon R sports Suzuki's characteristic boxy design with a trapezium grille, chrome accents, and large trapezium-styled halogen headlights complemented by dual circular fog lights. The rear features stacked rectangular vertical side-swept taillights and a roof spoiler, while the tailgate offers both key and remote operation. Inside, the VXR variant offers beige fabric upholstery, while the VXL comes in black, with a three-spoke power steering wheel wrapped in urethane and silver garnish. Standard features include a manual air conditioner, keyless entry with immobilizer, and a 2-speaker stereo system with CD, AUX, and USB inputs. The VXL adds power windows, central door locking, security alarm, remote control door locks, turn-over type outside door mirrors, under-seat tray, and a tachometer. Common interior features include front window defroster, side demister, and rear window demister. Powering the Wagon R is a 1.0-liter Euro 2 petrol engine generating 50 kW of power and 90 Nm of torque, paired with a smooth 5-speed manual transmission. It achieves fuel efficiencies of up to 14 KM/L in urban areas and 17 KM/L on highways, with an estimated range of 490 KM to 595 KM from its 35-liter fuel tank. The car offers a smooth ride with easy handling, though engine noise and vibration increase with speed, typical for three-cylinder engines. Maintenance is convenient and affordable due to local assembly and widespread availability of parts across Pakistan.

As part of the fourth generation launched in 2020, the Tucson offers two variants in Pakistan: the Hyundai Tucson FWD A/T GLS Sport and the Hyundai Tucson AWD A/T Ultimate, catering to different preferences and driving needs.Externally, the Hyundai Tucson features Hyundai's distinctive design language. The front fascia is characterized by sleek narrow side swept headlights with tube-designed LED daytime running light inserts, complemented by a small chrome grille and dual fog lights. The rear sports a roof spoiler with an integrated brake light, sharp side swept taillights, and a standard case tailgate. These elements contribute to the Tucson's unique aesthetic within its class.Inside, the Tucson's interior combines dark and light grey plastic trim pieces with fabric-covered front and rear seats, emphasizing both durability and comfort. The highlight of the interior is a new 10-inch touchscreen display, integrated into a redesigned center stack. Standard features include power and heated door mirrors, automatic climate control, a stereo speaker system, power windows, power steering, cruise control, and power lock doors. While offering a spacious interior for its class, the Tucson ensures a comfortable and refined driving experience.Under the hood, the Tucson 2024 in Pakistan is powered by a 2.0-liter DOHC 16-valve inline-4 engine, delivering 155 horsepower at 6200 rpm and 196 Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. This engine is paired with a responsive 6-speed automatic transmission, ensuring efficient performance suitable for both city driving and highway cruising. The Tucson's fuel efficiency is commendable, achieving approximately 10 km/l in city conditions and 12 km/l on highways, contributing to cost savings and reduced environmental impact.In terms of ride and handling, the Tucson 2024 offers swift steering response that enhances maneuverability in various driving conditions. However, it exhibits noticeable body roll at higher speeds, which might affect some drivers' preferences for handling dynamics. Despite this, the overall driving experience remains comfortable and responsive, meeting the expectations for a crossover SUV in its class.Maintaining the Tucson in Pakistan is facilitated by the availability of locally produced auto parts, although maintenance costs can be relatively high due to the newness of the model.

First launched in 2013, the BJ40 initially featured a 2.4-liter four-cylinder petrol engine and came in four variants: BJ40 S, BJ40 P, BJ40 C, and BJ40 SE. In 2019, it received a facelift named BJ40 Plus, with a 2.0-liter turbo engine and updated design.The BJ40 Plus 2024 boasts a robust exterior with a high anti-roll frame and 210 mm ground clearance, resembling the Jeep Wrangler. Its front features a vertical grille with LED headlamps, daytime running lights, and fog lamps. The interior includes monochromatic and polychromatic ambient lighting. The car has bright silver plating on the exterior and is equipped with front and rear red towbars, skid pads, radar brackets, and green window glass for sun protection. Additional features include automatic wipers and a high-mounted stop lamp.Inside, the BJ40 Plus offers a clean, bold design with a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a 12.3"" LCD instrument panel displaying various metrics, and an anti-glare rearview mirror. The seats are adjustable, with the driverÕs seat offering electric lumbar adjustment. The car has a 10.25"" HD central control panel for multimedia and phone connectivity, a hi-fi stereo system with six speakers, USB ports, and onboard Wi-Fi. It also features automatic air conditioning and an automotive-grade CN95 air filtration system.The BJ40 Plus is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged petrol engine producing 218 hp and 320 Nm of torque, available with a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. It supports four driving modes: ECO, comfort, sport, and snowfield, and includes an electrical part-time 4WD. The car has a fuel consumption of 14.9 liters per 100 km in the city and 8.0 liters on highways, with an 80-liter fuel tank and a top speed of 160 km/h.Equipped for off-road adventures, the BJ40 Plus has several safety and driver-assist features. Its assembly in Pakistan by Sazgar Motors ensures easy availability of spare parts and maintenance. The BJ40 Plus competes internationally with the Jeep Wrangler and locally with vehicles like the Haval H6, Toyota Fortuner, and Toyota Hilux Revo.
